## Summary

ChatRWKV is like ChatGPT but powered by the RWKV (100% RNN) language model, and open source. 

[RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)
"RWKV is a RNN with transformer-level LLM performance. It can be directly trained like a GPT (parallelizable). So it's combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, saves VRAM, fast training, "infinite" ctx_len, and free sentence embedding. "
